# Decadence
Plaintext music tracker and shell

Copyright (c) 2018 Grady O'Connell

Status: Just started. Still prototyping.

I wanted to track music in my text editor because I'm quite fast with it.
The available options weren't good enough.
This is my attempt at making a column-oriented, music tracker that works from
a text editor and includes an interactie midi shell.

I plan to make a vim plugin for this as well to follow the song and hear individual sections (see integration.vim for temporary usage)

Currently I test on Linux using the Helm softsynth

# Overview

Each column is a "channel" and they default to separate midi channel numbers.
Channels sequence notes.  You'll usually play at least 1 channel per instrument.

By default, any note event in a channel will mute previous notes on that channel

Numbered note notation is encouraged as it can better support
transposition and can take advantage of the scale/mode system (not yet impl).

The following will play the C major scale using numbered notation:
```
; Major Scale -- this is a comment, write whatever you want here!

; 120bpm subdivided into 2 (i.e., eighth notes)
%t120 g2

1
2
3
4
5
6
7
1'
```

The tempo is in BPM, and the grid is based in subdivisions.
Musicians can think of grid as fractions of quarter note,
whereas grid=1 is quarter, grid=2 is eighth notes, grid=3 is eighth triplet, etc.

Both Tempo and Grid can be decimal numbers as well.

## Transposition and Octaves

Notice the bottom line has an extra apostrophe character (').  This plays the note in the next octave
For an octave below, use a comma (,).
If you prefer to have these octave shifts persist, the < and > symbols can be used instead.
You can add a number at the end of these to increase the shift (For example, >2 puts 2 octaves above and persists).

## Holding Muting

Notes will continue playing automatically, until they're muted or another note is played in the same channel.

You can mute notes with -

To control muting of notes, use Dash (-).  The period (.) is simply a placeholder, so notes continue to be played through them.
```

; short note
1
-

; long note
1
.
.
.
-

```

Notes that are played in the same channel as other notes mute previous notes.
In order to overide this, hold a note by suffixing it with underscore (_).

A (-) character will then mute them all.

```
; Let's hold some notes
1_
3_
5_
7_
-
```


You'll notice completely blank lines are ignored, so be careful to always have a dot if you want the row to take time to play

## Chord

You can choose to play notes separately in channels, or use chords to put all
the notes in a single channel.

Let's try some chords:

```
%t120 g2
1maj
2m
3m
4maj
5maj
6m
7dim
1maj'
```

There are lots of chords and voicing (check the .py file under CHORDS and CHORDS_ALT) and I'll be adding a lot more.

# Arpeggios and Strumming

Chords can be walked if they are suffixed by '&'
Be sure to rest in your song long enough to hear it cycle.

```
1maj&
.
.
.
```

After the &, you can put a number to denote the number of cycles.
By default, it cycles infinitely until muted

# Velocity and Gain/Volume

Control velocity and gain of notes using the v## or g## flags respectfully
All velocity and gain values go from 0-9 in every digit, like in decimal numbers
Example: v0 in min, v9 is max.  But also: v00 is minimum, v99 is max
Use more numbers for increased precision (Careful, v9 is 100% where as v09 is ~9.1%)

# Articulation

Tilda(~) is another command, but sets mod wheel value
It is intended to be used for vibrato.
Vibrato functionality will change to pitch wheel oscillation in the future

# Channels

Columns are separate channels, line them up for more than one instrument

```
1<2  1
.    4
.    5
.    1'
.    4'
.    5'
.    1'2
```
# Markers

not yet impl

# Commands

Command line parameters (use -):

- c: issue command
- l: play a single line (string)

Command line AND global (% line) variables:
- t: start tempo
- g: start grid
- n: start note value
- p: set midi patches
    - command-separated list of patches across channels
    - GM instruments names fuzzy match (Example: Piano,Organ,Flute)

Global commands:

- %: set vars
- ;: comment
- :: set marker (requires name)
- @: go to mark
- @@: pop mark, go back to last
- @@@: exit
- |: set separators
    - allows you to draw separate each column by a fixed size
    - allows you to have spaces in note events on the same channel

Channel commands:

- >: shift octave up (persists)
    - number provided for octave count, default 1
- <: shift octave down (persists)
    - number provided for octave count, default 1
- ': play in octave above
    - number provided for octave count, default 1
- ,: play in octave below
    - number provided for octave count, default 1
- ch: assign channel to a midi channel
    - midi channels exceeding max value will be multiplexed to different outputs
- pc: program assign
    - Set program to a given number
    - Global var (%) p is usually prefered for string matching
- cc: control change (midi CC param)
    - setting CC5 to 25 would be c5:25
- bs: bank select (not impl)
- ~: vibrato, currently set to mod wheel
- ": repeat last cell (ignoring dots, blanks, mutes, modified repeats don't repeat)
- *: set note length
    - defaults to one beat when used
    - repeating symbol doubles note length
    - add a number to do multiplies (i.e. .5)
- .: half note length
    - halfs note value with each dot
    - add extra dot for using w/o note event (i.e. during arpeggiator), since lone dots dont mean anything
    - add a number to do multiplies (i.e. C.2)
- !: accent a note (or set velocity)
    - repeat for louder notes
- ?: play note quietly (or set velocity)
    - repeat for quieter notes

That's all I have so far!
