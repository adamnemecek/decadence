# Decadence
Use your text editor as a music tracker

Copyright (c) 2018 Grady O'Connell

Status: Just started. Still prototyping.

I wanted to track music in my text editor because I'm quite fast with it.
The available options weren't good enough.
This is my attempt at making a column-oriented, music tracker that works from
a text editor.

I plan to make a vim plugin for this as well to follow the song and hear individual sections (see integration.vim for temporary usage)

## Features

- Implemented
    - Numbered and lettered note notation
    - Built-in chords
    - Velocity, Transposition, Vibrato
    - Note holding
    - Chord and Voicing support
    - Markers w/ Callstack (use :name to set, and @name to jump, @@ to return)
    - MIDI CC events
    - Chord Arpeggiator
- Planned
    - Scales and key signature (not yet impl)

## Tutorial

INCOMPLETE
    
Each column is called a channel (not to be confused with midi channel).
Channels sequence notes.  
By default, any note event in a channel will mute previous notes on that channel

Separate each column by at least 2 spaces.

Numbered note notation is encouraged as it can better support
transposition and can take advantage of the scale/mode system (not yet impl).

The following will play the C major scale using numbered notation:
```
; Major Scale -- this is a comment, write whatever you want here!

; 120bpm subdivided into 2 (i.e., eighth notes)
%tempo=120 grid=2

1
2
3
4
5
6
7
1'
```

The tempo is in BPM, and the grid is based in subdivisions.
Musicians can think of grid as fractions of quarter note,
whereas grid=1 is quarter, grid=2 is eighth notes, grid=3 is eighth triplet, etc.

Both Tempo and Grid can be decimal numbers as well.

## Transposition and Octaves

Notice the bottom line has an extra apostrophe character (').  This plays the note in the next octave
For an octave below, use a comma (,).
If you prefer to have these octave shifts persist, the < and > symbols can be used instead.
You can add a number at the end of these to increase the shift (For example, >2 puts 2 octaves above and persists).

## Holding Muting

Notes will continue playing automatically, until they're muted or another note is played in the same channel.

You can mute notes with -

To control muting of notes, use Dash (-).  The period (.) is simply a placeholder, so notes continue to be played through them.
```

; short note
1
-

; long note
1
.
.
.
-

```

Notes that are played in the same channel as other notes mute previous notes.
In order to overide this, hold a note by suffixing it with underscore (_).

A (-) character will then mute them all.

```
; Let's hold some notes
%tempo
1_
3_
5_
7_
-
```


You'll notice completely blank lines are ignored, so be careful to always have a dot if you want the row to take time to play

## Chord

You can choose to play notes separately in channels, or use chords to put all
the notes in a single channel.

Let's try some chords:

```
%tempo=120 grid=2
1maj
2m
3m
4maj
5maj
6m
7dim
1maj'
```

There are lots of chords and voicing (check the .py file under CHORDS and CHORDS_ALT) and I'll be adding a lot more.

# Arpeggios and Strumming

Chords can be walked if they are suffixed by '&'
Be sure to rest in your song long enough to hear it cycle.

```
1maj&
.
.
.
```

After the &, you can put a number to denote the number of cycles.
By default, it cycles infinitely until muted

# Velocity and Gain/Volume

Control velocity and gain of notes using the v## or g## flags respectfully
All velocity and gain values go from 0-9 in every digit, like in decimal numbers
Example: v0 in min, v9 is max.  But also: v00 is minimum, v99 is max
Use more numbers for increased precision (Careful, v9 is 100% where as v09 is ~9.1%)

# Articulation

Tilda(~) is another command, but sets mod wheel value
It is intended to be used for vibrato.
Vibrato functionality will change to pitch wheel oscillation in the future

# Channels

Columns are separate channels, line them up for more than one instrument

```
1<2  1
.    4
.    5
.    1'
.    4'
.    5'
.    1'2
```
# Markers

not yet impl

# Commands

Global commands:
    - %: set vars
    - ;: comment
    - :: set marker (requires name)
    - @: go to mark
    - @@: pop mark, go back to last
    - @@@: exit

Variables:
    - tempo: current tempo of project
    - grid: subdivisions / note value

Channel commands:
    - m: assign channel to a midi channel
        - midi channels exceeding max value will be multiplexed to different outputs
    - p: program assign
    - c: control change (midi CC param)
        - use 
    - x: bank select
    - Articulation (customizable effect)
        - ~: vibrato
        - /: bend up to note
        - \: bend down to down
    - ": repeat last cell (ignoring dots, blanks, mutes)
    - ^: staccato

That's all I have so far!
